# Network Device Configuration Tool

## Overview

The Network Device Configuration Tool is a Python script designed to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with network devices using the Exscript library. It establishes an SSH connection to a specified network device, reads login credentials and router IP information from a CSV file, and executes various commands and configuration changes.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Exscript library (`pip install Exscript`)

## Usage

1. **GUI Interface:**
   - The script creates a Tkinter-based GUI with input fields for Aterm credentials and displays an image.

2. **SSH Connection:**
   - Establishes an SSH connection to the network device (`aterm.tedata.net`) on port `9090`.

3. **CSV Files:**
   - Reads login credentials and router IP information from `'credentials and Router IP.csv'`.
   - Loads additional configuration data from `'input.csv'`.

4. **Telnet and Commands:**
   - Performs telnet on the network device.
   - Executes initial commands based on CSV data, such as telnet and login.

5. **Configuration Changes:**
   - Loads configuration data from `'input.csv'`.
   - Makes configuration changes on the network device, including interface removal and L2VPN group adjustments.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Catches and prints any exceptions that might occur during execution.
   - Prompts the user to acknowledge and exit the application in case of an error.

## Configuration Files

### 'credentials and Router IP.csv'

This CSV file should have the following format:

```plaintext
username,password,login_username,login_password,router_ip
JohnDoe,secretpass,user1,password1,192.168.1.1
```

### 'input.csv'

This CSV file should have the following format:

```plaintext
interface,l2vpn_group,p2p_value
eth0,group1,value1
eth1,group2,value2
```

## How to Run

1. Execute the script: `python script.py`.
2. Enter Aterm credentials. 
3. Press the "Submit" button to initiate the network device interaction.

## Notes

- Ensure proper file paths and permissions for reading CSV files.
- Verify that the specified network device is reachable and accessible.
- Adjust command execution based on specific network device requirements.
